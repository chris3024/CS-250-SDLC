#### <ins>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</ins>
Interpreting the user's needs when it comes to developing the best possible program is extremely important. By conducting meetings with the clients can give you a better 
view and more precise information on what they are wanting from the software. By creating the user stories, you are essentially putting the requirements into a formatted 
output that is easy for everyone to interpret.

#### <ins>How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?</ins>
Approaching the development of programs can follow many different paths and what is good for one development may not be good for another development. So first having a plan is very important. Thus, meetings and Sprint planning play a huge role in helping lay out the development path. I also will look to start to implement better test cases when I am working on my own developments.

#### <ins>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</ins>
Being a good team member is being able to work well with others, and always open to communication from the other team members. It also the ability to learn from those
that are around you, taking both the praise and criticism in stride and to make yourself better.
